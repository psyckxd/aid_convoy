This repository is used to capture the operations of the humanitarian aid supply chains and resources, such as was provided formerly by. aid organizations such as USAID.

Recent political changes worldwide have interrupted humanitarian aid supply chains. As people are released, decades of institutional and contractual knowledge is being extinquished. If you are contributor or stakeholder in the worldwide humanitarian aid programs that are being deconstructed, please post your non-confidential non-personal description of how good and services for aid flowed through your jurisdiction. For example:

/aid_convoy/africa/aid_to_congo/readme.md - describe how drugs need refrigeration needs power needs fuel needs a technician. Operations of the refrigeration unit, etc.

Please fork or replicate this open-source MIT licensed information if needed for privacy or security.

The goal is to capture the organizational flow so that it can be reconstructed. Thank you for your contributions.
